# Black-Jack-Game
The game is really simple. Essentially, you're trying to get as close to 21 as possible.
All of the cards which you have will be counted as their value except a Jack, a Queen, or a King count as 10.
Initially, two cards will be distributed and only one card of the dealer(computer) will be revealed.
If your sum of cards is less than 21, then you might risk for another card.
Anytime you can to show your card. The one having the less score will win.
